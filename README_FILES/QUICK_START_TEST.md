## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: Backend won't start
**Error**: "Address already in use"
**Fix**: 
```bash
lsof -i :8000
kill -9 <PID>
# Then restart backend
```

### Issue: Frontend won't start
**Error**: "port 3000 already in use"
**Fix**:
```bash
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
# Then restart frontend
```

### Issue: "Cannot GET /"
**Cause**: Backend not running
**Fix**: Ensure both backends are active (see commands above)

### Issue: Layout looks wrong (columns stacked)
**Cause**: Window too narrow
**Fix**: Maximize browser window or use full-screen (F11)

### Issue: Filters say "disabled until timetable generated"
**Cause**: Haven't generated yet
**Fix**: Click "✨ Generate" button after selecting courses

### Issue: Grid shows "No valid timetables found"
**Cause**: Courses have conflicts or no valid combination
**Fix**: Try different courses or uncheck optimize
